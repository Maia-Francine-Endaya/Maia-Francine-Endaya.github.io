              <p>Hello my name is Maia Francine Endaya. I have dabbled into many aspects of video game development, such
                as coding,
                game design, and game art. But I have found that I mainly specialize in game art, both 2D and 3D.</p>
              <p><b>Below are game art programs that I have experience with:</b></p>

              <p>
                But, I do not just specialize in game art, I have also dabbled in the technical side of game
                development.
              </p>

                Outside of game development, I have experience in other media, such as animation. Below is my portfolio:

          <h2><b><u>SaluSalo: A VR Filipino Cooking Sim</u></b></h2>
          <p><b><u>SaluSalo</u></b> is a Virtual Reality cooking simulator with a focus on Filipino Cuisine. This is
            one of the major
            projects
            that helped fluorish my 3D Modelling skills. As I continued working on the projects, I find myself learning
            new things about the process of 3D modelling.</p>

          <h2><b><u>Astropong</u></b></h2>
          <p><b><u>Astropong</u></b> is a hypercasual game that combines the two classic arcade games; Asteroids and
            Pong. I was responsible for the visuals of the game and have done a bit of coding for the game. I was also
            responsible for the background music for the game, which allowed me to dabble into the audio-engineering
            side of the development.</p>

          <p><b><u>Darkend</u></b> is an upcoming roguelike action game where you will be fighting against froces of
            evil.
            This is another project where I explored my skills in doing pixel art. At this point, I have brushed up my
            skills enough to know how to be meticulous with pixel placement. It also allowed me to learn new techniques
            in animating pixel art.</p>

            by
            ascending
            the tower with the orb. This is the project that allowed me to explore pixel art. It became the starting
            point for
            my own pixel art journey. This project also made me discover the process of level design.</p>

          <p><b><u>Nigeru Ohime-sama!</u></b> is a stealth game where you help a princess escape the castle. While I
            have not done major assets, I was tasked with the level design. In the process, I learned to love making
            game spaces that build the game world and to challenge the player. This is also a project where I delve into
            audio design.</p>

          <p> An Interactive Map for Commission of Higher Education's Office. I have worked as a project tracker,
            keeping track of the progress and updates of the project. From here, I learned how to track the progress of
            projects, which I apply for my personal projects. This is also a project where I learned a bit of web

          <h2><b><u>VR Proof of Concept</u></b></h2>
          <p> During an internship with Techcare, I was tasked to make a waiting room for VR. Along the process,
            I learned a lot about VR development and had since sparked my interest in making virtual worlds for VR and AR.
            It has honed my 3D modelling skills and environment/level design.
